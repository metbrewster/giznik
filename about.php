				<h3>Information about Seaboard Virtual Airlines</h3><br>
				<p>In March 2013, Matt Larsen and Jon Asher decided on creating Seaboard Virtual Airlines, a new virtual airline. They didn't set out to create a huge airline with hundreds of pilots (though that would be nice); rather, they set out to run a functioning airline, where all pilots would work as a family to an extent. With experience, Matt and Jon have come to realize that when it comes to virtual airlines, quality outweighs quantity. Very often, an airline with 15 active pilots who fly four to five times per week can easily be more fun to fly for and more successful than an airline with 100 pilots who each fly one or two flights per month.</p><br>
				<p>The goal of Seaboard is to unite a miniature community of pilots who all have a great passion for aviation. A great way to carry this out (besides flying often) is to fly together on a multiplayer server. Unfortunately, with the recent collapse of Gamespy support for FSX, that is not always possible. Luckily, there is one great community that unites pilots together, and just happens to be based at our center of operations. <a href="http://bostonvirtualatc.com">Boston Virtual ATC</a> is a LAN based multiplayer community that as you may have guessed, is based out of Boston Logan International Airport. The administrators here at Seaboard strongly recommend all pilots to join and fly in their community. Boston Virtual ATC provides live air traffic control in the Boston area on a daily basis. It provides a great learning opportunity for Seaboard pilots, and also makes the simulation that much more realistic.</p><br>
				<p>If Seaboard Virtual Airlines were to exist in the real world, we would be considered a low-cost carrier. Based in Boston, we provide flights up and down the eastern seaboard. In fact, there are no airports that Seaboard services that are west of the Appalachian Mountains.</p><br>
